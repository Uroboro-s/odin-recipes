    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza, favored by all ages, dates back to 1889. Pizza, garnished with Mozzarella and tomatoes, was normally known as the 
        dish for poor people <br>until it became a famous dish for the wealthy when Queen Margherita had it as a meal as well. Pizza,
         with sauces and spices such as basil and garlic <br>added later on, gets recognition by other nations with the arrival of Italian
          immigrants to the United States.  The spread of pizza all over the world is <br>due to the initiatives of the Americans.

        At that time in Italy, pizzas were made with Mozzarella and tomatoes however later on were served with different ingredients used 
        today. Pizza, which has<br> spread quickly outside of the USA, has become a favorite dish for consumers of all ages.

        large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.)
