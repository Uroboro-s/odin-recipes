        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chocolate Milkshake is the simplest yet the most tastiest milkshake ever loved by both kids and adults! It is a protein-rich 
            drink with a sugary <br>flavour. Usually one adds ice-creams to it, further enhancing its flavour. One might think that a drink 
            simple as a chocolate milkshake would have existed since <br>the <em>fucking</em> Big Bang but nope, it was discovered much more 
            recently than what  you probably imagined!

            The story goes that a Walgreens employee in Chicago got a little crazy and decided to put two scoops of ice cream in a chocolate
             malt, which was made<br> using an electric blender. After that, the drink quickly became a hit all throughout the United States. The
              rest is milkshake history!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li >2 cups vanilla ice cream</li> 
            <li >1/2 cup whole milk, cold</li> 
            <li >1/4 cup chocolate syrup</li>
            <li >1/4 cup chocolate chips, optional</li>
            <li >Whipped cream, garnish</li>
            <li >Shaved chocolate, garnish</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li >Gather the ingredients.</li> 
            <li >Place the ice cream, milk, and chocolate syrup into the blender. If using chocolate chips, add those as well. Be mindful that the harder the ice cream
                 is, the better, as the blending process can liquefy the ice cream too much and make the milkshake too thin.</li> 
            <li >Blend the ingredients until completely smooth.</li>
            <li >Pour into your glasses immediately, top with whipped cream, and decorate with shaved chocolate. Enjoy!</li>
