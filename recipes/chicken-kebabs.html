        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Kebabs are one of the many great innovations and inventions borne of war. In medieval times, soldiers used to grill 
            meat over open-field<br> fires using their swords. This origin is backed up by a Turkish script of Kyssa-I Yusuf in 1377
            and is now the oldest known source where kebab is stated as a food item. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The meat used to make kebabs may be lamb, chicken, beef and fish. The chicken version of kebabs is actually a much later 
            invention. Originally<br> lambs were used. Some people still shun kebabs made from something other than lamb, especially chicken.
            But... don't get disheartened or disillusioned <br>by some <em>narcissistic</em>, conservative comment or you will regret not trying 
            this <em>kebabilicous </em> dish!

        <ol>
           <li><details>
            <summary>Rinse the Chicken</summary>
            Wash and pat dry the chicken. Make slits in it with a knife.
        </details></li>

            <summary>Prepare Ginger-Garlic Paste</summary>
            Add in Garlic and Ginger mix it in a Blender and puree.
            Keep the Ginger-Garlic paste aside.
            Begin the Chicken Marination.

            <summary>#Marinate1</summary>
            In a mixing bowl break the eggs into a container and whisk them using a spoon.
            Addsalt, chili powder, kabab powder, ginger garlic paste and all the above ingredients except the chicken and mix well.
            Make a thick batter of flowing consistency by adding enough water little by little
            If the paste is too thick then you can add more lemon juice or a little water.
            Once a thick paste is formed, taste the marinade and then based on your taste needs you can add more of the ingredients.
        </details></li> 
           <li><details>
            <summary>#Marinate2</summary>
            Add chicken to a bogitmwl. Make sure there is no water. Excess moisture either in the chicken or curd is going to drip off the chicken and make kababs not so good.
            Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well until every chicken piece is evenly coated with the marinade.
        </details></li> 
           <li><details>
            <summary>Refrigerate</summary>
            After you marinate the chicken with marinade and mix well.Now set aside the marinated chicken, the marinade must enter 
            each slit. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for about 3-4 hours. Do not skip this step, these 3-4 hours are important to
            allow the flavors from the marinade to get into the chicken. If you do not have enough time, then freeze it for half an
             hour (do not freeze for more hours).

            the marinated chicken till they turn red and crisp outside as seen in the picture.
            Do not over crowd the pan while frying, fry it in small batches for better results.
